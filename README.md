## Quantum Enhanced GAN for HEP

### Overview 
To enhance the generative adversarial networks used in the high energy physics (HEP) community for fast event simulation with Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM), a versatile and efficient quantum model, to sample the prior (latent space). The quantum enhanced architecture, Quantum Circuit Associative Adversarial Network (QC-AAN), was shown previously to not only have similar performance as DCGAN but also has practical quantum advantages such as greater training stability on MNIST [1]. Instabilities of the training caused by diverging gradient and vanishing gradient are a major practical concern, especially for the HEP community\*. So, if a QC-AAN can make the training for GANs more robust, we would expect it to have practical value for the HEP community. 

\* To overcome the training instability, HEP community often uses Wasserstein GANs. Due to time constraints, we plan to investigate a quantum enhanced Wassertein GANs in the future.
